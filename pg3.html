    <center><h1>Automatic high beam and low beem </h1></center>
    <p>An automatic high beam system uses a camera or light sensor to detect ambient light and <br>
        the presence of other vehicles' headlights, automatically switching between high and low beams <br>
        to optimize visibility and reduce glare. The layout involves strategically placing <br>
        the sensor (often a camera) and the control module within the vehicle, typically near<br>
         the rearview mirror or windshield, to effectively monitor the road ahead. </p>
